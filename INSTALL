Building and installing KDE Partition Manager Core Library from source
=========================================================


1. Dependencies

libparted: Either get it from http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/download.shtml
and build it yourself or, preferably, install your distribution's packages
(don't forget the dev-package).

libblkid: Part of the util-linux project available at
https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux

libatasmart: Available from http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/being-smart.html

KDE Frameworks: The minimum required version is 5.0.


2. Configure

KPMcore is built with cmake. It is recommended to build out of tree:
After unpacking the source, create a separate build directory and run cmake there:

$ tar xfj kpmcore-x.y.z.tar.bz2
$ cd kpmcore-x.y.z
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

If all dependencies are met, cmake configures the build directory.


3. Build and install

Just run make and make install in the build directory. The default install path
is /usr/local, so installing will need write privileges there. You can
configure a different install path by passing
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your_path> to cmake when configuring. To change the
install path after configuring and building, run

$ ccmake .

in the build directory and modify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX there.
