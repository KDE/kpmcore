Building and installing KDE Partition Manager Core Library from source
=========================================================


1. Dependencies

util-linux 2.32: available at https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux

KDE Frameworks: The minimum required version is 5.0.

2. Configure

KPMcore is built with cmake. It is recommended to build out of tree:
After unpacking the source, create a separate build directory and run cmake there:

$ tar xf kpmcore-x.y.z.tar.xz
$ cd kpmcore-x.y.z
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

If all dependencies are met, cmake configures the build directory.


3. Build and install

Just run make and make install in the build directory. The default install path
is /usr/local, so installing will need write privileges there. You can
configure a different install path by passing
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your_path> to cmake when configuring. To change the
install path after configuring and building, run

$ ccmake .

in the build directory and modify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX there.
